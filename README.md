This is an open source project on GitHub that I have been involved in.

The project aims to develop a predictive support system based on the symptoms provided by users, helping them to know the pathologies and give appropriate recommendations. I have contributed to improving the technical prediction and developing the user manual, guiding users to easily access and use this application.

If you want to refer or know more details about the project, visit the project page on GitHub to learn more.
